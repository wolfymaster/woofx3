- **Primary Frontend**: Streamlabs (Remix-based React application)
- **Port**: 5000 (configured for Replit environment)
- **Workflow**: "Streamlabs Frontend" - running successfully

## Recent Changes (2025-09-13)
- Installed required programming languages (Node.js 20, Go 1.24, Rust stable)
- Configured primary frontend service for Replit environment
- Updated vite.config.ts to use host 0.0.0.0 and port 5000
- Modified server.ts to bind to 0.0.0.0:5000 for Replit proxy compatibility
- Added graceful error handling for external services (OBS, NATS)
- Fixed package.json dev script to use bun for TypeScript execution
- Added basic API stubs to prevent 404 errors
- Configured deployment settings for production (autoscale)

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React, Remix, Vite, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Go, Bun (TypeScript), Express
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQLite
- **External Integrations**: Twitch API, OBS WebSocket, NATS messaging
- **Languages**: TypeScript, Go, Rust, Lua

## Configuration Notes
- External services (OBS, NATS) are optional and gracefully handled when not configured
- Environment variables needed for full functionality:
  - `INSTANTDB_ADMIN_TOKEN`: For database operations
  - `OBS_HOST`, `OBS_PORT`, `OBS_RPC_TOKEN`: For OBS integration
  - `NATS_USER_JWT`, `NATS_NKEY_SEED`: For message bus
  - Various Twitch API credentials

## User Preferences
- Development environment optimized for streaming/content creation tools
- Multi-service architecture maintained as intended
- Graceful degradation when external services unavailable

## Running the Application
The primary frontend is accessible via the Replit preview at port 5000. Additional services can be started individually or via the process-compose.yml configuration for local development.
